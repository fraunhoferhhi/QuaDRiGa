%FIND_OVERLAPPING_SNAPSHOTS Tinds the overlapping snapshot indices of the two channelsegments
%
% Two tracks overlap as in the following example ( x = snapshot )
%
%                 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
%   Track 1:      x  x  i  x  x  x  x  x                <-- i = initial position
%   Track 2:                  x  x  x  x  i  x  x       <-- i = initial position

%
% Input:
%   h_channel
%   An [ 1 x N ] array of channel objects obtained from "qd_builder".
%
%   ic1
%   Index of the current segment [ 1 x 1 ]
%
%   ic2
%   Index of the second segment that overlaps with the current one  [ 1 x 1 ]
%
%   overlap
%   The overlapping fraction
%
%   seg_ind
%   The index-list of the sgements [ N x 1 ]
%
% Output:
%   is1n
%   The non-overlapping part of the first segment ranging from the initial position of the
%   first segment to the beginning of the overlappig part. Example: [ 3,4 ]
%
%   is1o
%   The overlapping part of the first segment. Example: [ 5,6,7,8 ]
%
%   is2o
%   The overlapping part of the second segment. Example: [ 1,2,3,4 ]
%
%   isn
%   The snapshot indices of the non-overlapping part in the output channel
%
%   iso
%   The snapshot indices of the overlapping part in the output channel
